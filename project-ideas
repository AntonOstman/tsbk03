global illumination methods ?

path tracing seems fun :) -> basically not possible real time without denoising
ray tracing? not new method but 
denoise with spatial and temporal reuse

voxel cone tracing: method for estimating local illumination using cones
instant radiosiy: more like virtual light, indirect light sources act as real light source
- Real-time stochatic lightcuts
irradiance fields
-loeaking and over-occlusion

Radiance caching for real-time global illumination
-unreal engine
